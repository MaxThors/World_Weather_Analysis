# Using Google Maps Directions API to Track Weather and Vacation Destinations

## Overview of Project
The overall purpose of this project was to look at weather and potential vacation spots around the world to fit temperature criteria 
and  the hotels that were near these cities. We used API's with OpenWeatherMap and Google Maps to complete the project. We first filtered
on random cities based on temperature and then we picked some cities in Australia to track the travel between the cities. We also used
heat maps to visualize the maps. Here are the maps we produced:
